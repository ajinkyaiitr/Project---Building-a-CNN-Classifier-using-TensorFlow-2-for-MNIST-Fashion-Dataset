Import numpy as np.

import << your code comes here >> as << your code comes here >>
Import tensorflow as tf and check the version of tensorflow.

import << your code comes here >> as << your code comes here >>
print("Tensorflow version", tf.__version__)
Import keras from tensorflow and check the version of keras.

from tensorflow import << your code comes here >>
print("Keras version", <<your code comes here >>)
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

import  << your code comes here >> as << your code comes here >>
Set the random seed for tf and np so as to reuse the same set of random variables and reproduce the results.

np.random.seed(42) 
tf.random.set_seed(42)
