In this project, we will learn how to build a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow 2.

About the Data Set

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images —consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label.

The objective of the project is - to use Fashion-MNIST data set to identify (predict) different fashion products(articles) from the given images using Deep Learning.
