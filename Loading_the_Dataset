Let's load the fashion MNIST dataset. Keras has a number of functions to load popular datasets in keras.datasets. The dataset is already split for you between a training set and a test set.
Get the fashion mnist dataset module from keras using keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.

fashion_mnist = << your code comes here >>
Load and sort the data into train and test sets using load_data() function of fashion_mnist:

(X_train_full, y_train_full), (X_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.<< your code comes here >>
Let us see the shape of the training dataset.

X_train_full.shape

CODE
---------------------------
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(X_train_full,y_train_full), (X_test,y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
X_train_full.shape
